# Add-Two-Decimal-Numbers
A program that adds two decimal numbers using the TRAP #15 function with task #4.

Store the results at address $6000. Print out the result in command output window in decimal format by using the TRAP #15 function with tast #3.
If an overflow occurs I print out the error message.
